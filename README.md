# Video Retrieval System

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a Video Retrieval System, where videos are encoded by texts generated by a Video Question Answering (VQA) model. The VQA model provides descriptive text about the video's content, allowing for efficient and accurate retrieval based on natural language queries.

## Features

- Encode videos with descriptive texts generated by a VQA model
- Retrieve videos based on natural language queries
- Capture various aspects of videos including actions, characters, setting, and more

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- [List any specific libraries and their versions]

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/video-retrieval-system.git
    cd video-retrieval-system
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### 1. Encoding Videos

To encode a video with descriptive texts using the VQA model, run:
```sh
python encode_video.py --video-path path/to/your/video.mp4
